A basic MERN application:



You can host both the Frontend (React) and Backend (node) on your device. cd into each folder inside the project, run "npm install" to install all required packages for both folders.


You can run "npm start" for EACH folder, the React App will load on localhost:3000, and your server on localhost:5000 (there's no Get /)


The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to create a basic connection between React & Node Server to store data (in this case, products).



Project Level: intermediate (React & Node experience)
